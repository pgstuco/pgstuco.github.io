  <h2>Back to School</h2>
  <h3>September 5, 2017</h3>
  <p>On September 5th, Point Grey's '17-18 Student Council gathered on the front steps of the school to prepare for the first day back. With the clock no more than quarter past 7 and only 2 hours to set up, Student Council members hustled to complete their assigned responsibilities to create the most welcoming atmosphere for our fellow Greyhounds. At 9 o'clock, student photographers went around the school to capture the reunion of students and to celebrate school spirit. In the afternoon, incoming grade eights were warmly greeted and led to their homerooms where Student Councilâ€™s Welcome Package awaits them. With a package consisting of a map, tips for high school, and other cool SWAG items, there is no doubt that the grade eights are more than ready to become the newest members of our Greyhound family. </p>

  <h2>Student Council Retreat</h2>
  <h3>July 04, 2017</h3>
  <p>On July 3rd, 2017, members of the 2017-2018 Point Grey Student Council gathered around the sun-baked docks of Granville Island for the Student Council Retreat. While the focus of the trip was to strengthen connections between council members and to establish a common vision, the student council participated in a wide range of activities, varying from scavenger hunts to group discussions. They also had the honor of being joined by past PG alumni who provided insight and advice on his experience as a leader who is involved with student societies. Without a doubt, the PG Student Council is excited put together a fun year for our fellow Greyhounds!</p>
